<p>
I sometimes hire undergraduate students for part-time research assistant positions.   If you have good marks in your courses and some practical experience (e.g., electronics, amateur radio, fpgas, machining, optics, 3-d printing, ...) --- perhaps obtained through your hobbies --- please get in contact with me (send CV/resume and unofficial grades report).

<h3> Research Interests: </h3>
<p> Experimental Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics (AMO), especially Rydberg atoms.  <br> <br>

For more information, please see
<a href="research/research.html">our publications</a>.
<br><br>  
<!-- More
specifically, interactions between highly excited "Rydberg" atoms,
and between Rydberg atoms and surfaces, using laser cooling and
trapping techniques. <br>

If you are interested in joining our group as a graduate student,
you are welcome to contact me
to discuss potential research projects.

<h3>Opportunities for undergraduates:</h3>
<p> Are you interested in acquiring some skills useful in experimental physics and learning how a fundamental technology works <em>from first principles</em>?  If so, you may be interested in building and testing an AM/FM radio!
</p>

<p>
<b> NOTE: regarding AM/FM radio project: I'm full up for the Spring 2018 term, but let me know if you are interested in Fall 2018 and beyond.  Thanks! --- Jim. </b>
UW Physics students (2nd year and higher) who are interested in constructing a
well-thought-out
AM/FM radio kit are invited
to get in contact with me.  I will provide you with a brand-new kit and guidance.  No experience is necessary --- just curiosity and some hard work.   By constructing and testing an AM/FM radio you will learn how to solder, the practical details of inductors, capacitors, and transistors, how to use an oscilloscope, etc... In other words, pretty useful stuff for a real experimental physicist! I enjoy electronics, and I want to share my knowledge and experience with those who also might be interested.

<h3> Teaching: </h3>
<p>
  I have taught a wide variety of courses here at UW, ranging from introductory second year optics to graduate quantum mechanics.  I have assembled <a href="teaching/my_greatest_hits/my_greatest_hits_generated.pdf">a small selection of problems</a> from these courses, that may be of interest to others.
</p>

<p>
I also have a selection of third year thermal physics problems available    <a href="teaching/lecture_notes/thermal_physics_extended_examples_generated.pdf">here</a>

</p>

<p>
  I'm working on a set of notes concerning special relativity and electromagnetic radiation:
  <a href="teaching/lecture_notes/accelerate_to_radiate_generated.pdf">Accelerate to radiate</a> They are suitable for upper-year and graduate students.  They are currently incomplete.
