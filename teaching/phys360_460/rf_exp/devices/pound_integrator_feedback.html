       <h2>Pound Integrator Feedback Control</h2>
<p>
A control loop stabilizes a physical quantity using measurement and feedback.  Feedback control of temperature is common:  a thermometer measures the temperature and the heater is adjusted accordingly to bring the measured temperature to the desired temperature.  In this experiment we use feedback to lock the frequency of a voltage controlled oscillator to a cavity resonance.  
</p>
<p>
The difference between the actual physical quantity and the value that we desire is known as the <i>error signal</i>.  The simplest type of control loop is an integrator -- which can be implemented using the classic op-amp integrator circuit.  If the input error signal is zero, the output voltage remains unchanged.  If the error signal goes either positive or negative, the output of the integrator ramps accordingly, until the error signal goes to zero again, at which point integration stops.
