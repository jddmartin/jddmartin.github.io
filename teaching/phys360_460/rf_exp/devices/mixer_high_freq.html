A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_mixer">mixer</a> 
essentially multiplies two input signals.  If the two inputs are of the same frequency, this will produce an output at twice the input frequency, and an output at DC.  The DC component will be proportional to the cosine of the phase angle between the two inputs.  Two signals that are completely in phase will give a maximum dc output, which will reduce to zero as the phase between them is varied to 90 degrees.  We will see a signal of opposite polarity for 180 degree phase difference.  Mixers are an essential part of almost all communication systems (transmitters and receivers) as a way to "translate" RF signals in frequency space.
